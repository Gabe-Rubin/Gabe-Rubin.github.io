            <h3>TL;DR</h3>
            <p>
                As a team of four, we worked through many labs.
                The labs and course were rocketry-centric.
                The course culminated with a project and presentation.
                We chose to do a 3D Trajectory Mapping of a Rocket.
                We got one of the highest powered rocket motors (I) available in the course.
                We almost broke the speed of sound!
                We were awarded the J. R. Phillips Award for demonstrating excellent experimental technique and engineering judgment.
                I got NAR certified.
                I Made some great friends!

                I'd love to write more and reflect more on this later. In the meantime, to get through the backlog, here's the résumé version.

              <li>Created a 3D trajectory mapping of a fiber-glassed reinforced rocket with a four-person team.</li>
              <li>Used redundant measurement systems with data logging to verify data obtained by an inertial measurement unit on an onboard circuit with filters.</li>
              <li>Ran simulations prior to launch using data obtained from rocket to estimate flight characteristics.</li>
